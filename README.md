# BatteryBoi

Ever leave your Android phone plugged in and charging and not realized it crossed 80% -- or worse -- it's 100% and overcharged?

Me, too. So I made a little tray icon + draggable form that reports your phone battery percentage when connected.

The tray icon and form tell you:
- Your phone is charging
- Your phone is 80%+ charged, and you should stop charging
- Your phone is disconnected, or an error occurred

Includes ADB, so just unpack the `.zip` and run it.

UI updates every 10 seconds.

Made with love in C# and Windows Forms.
