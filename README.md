# BatteryBoi

Ever leave your Android phone plugged in and charging and not realized it crossed 80% -- or worse -- it's 100% and overcharged?

Me, too. So I made a little tray icon + draggable form that reports your phone battery percentage when connected.

Updates every 10 seconds, and relies on `adb` being accessible via the terminal (set in `PATH`).

Made with love in C# and Windows Forms.
